Hi There!

We are very excited about kicking off this workshop. As a fun activity for getting comfortable with git and github - the medium we will use for sharing our code - lets add a bit about ourselves to this file. Then Add. Commit. Push! This will help all the participants and mentors to get to know each other. Try to include some fun, whacky facts about yourself :-)

Fun trivia about me: My masters degree from UCLA has Arnold Schwarzenegger’s autograph on it. I will treat any quizzing geniuses here who can guess the connection ;-)
